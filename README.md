My first repository.

Hello, world!
My name is Alexander. I am from Russia. Do not really know why did I start this repository, my dream is creation useful proggrams&scripts to automate the boring staff! 
P.S. I like constructive criticism and never take offense! So if there is something wrong in my text (cause my english pretty bad), pls tell me :)
